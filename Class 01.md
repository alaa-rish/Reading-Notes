# Introduction to React and Components

## What is a component?
A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.


## What are the charactistics of a component?
- Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.


## What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
- Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.


# What is Props and How to Use it in React?

### What is props short for?
- Props stand for properties and is a special keyword in React.
- Props are being passed to components like function arguments.
- Props can only be passed to components in one-way (parent to child).
- Props data is immutable (read-only).

### How are props used in React?
Props works after defining the attribute, after that works from parent to child components, then render it.




### What is the flow of props?
Unidirectional data flow is the idea that components should only receiveraise data in one direction. Child components should only call functions from parent components, while parent components should only set/pass data to their children.
